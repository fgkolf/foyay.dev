          Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm a software engineer based in Athens with experience in
          building things on the web and beyond. I am currently working at
          Skroutz.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a place where I share ideas, experiments, and things I find
          interesting. It also demonstrates some of my work and the stuff i
          am thrilled or curious about.
        </p>
